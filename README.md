# SwarmStrategy

Simple arcade game where you need to color as many circles on the gamefield  as you can. The winner is the one who painted over the most.

# How to run ?

The project is based on the Maven build system, so you just need to type the following commands to compile and run the game:


```
mvn install
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.App"
```

A window will pop up, where only two of the four buttons will be working: play and exit the game
